# summary

The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple tool for
considering the long-term outcomes of your daily
tasks and focusing on what will make you most
effective, not just most productive. It helps you
visualize all your tasks in a matrix of
urgent/important. All of your day-to-day tasks
and bigger projects will fall into one of these
four quadrants:

Urgent & Important tasks/projects to be completed
immediately

Not Urgent & Important tasks/projects to be
scheduled on your calendar

Urgent & Unimportant tasks/projects to be
delegated to someone else

Not Urgent & Unimportant tasks/projects to be
deleted

In the real world, the distinction between
urgent/non-urgent, important/not important is
much murkier than under experimental conditions.
